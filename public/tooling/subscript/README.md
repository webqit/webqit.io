## About

A general-purpose reactivity runtime for JavaScript, with an overarching philosophy of reactivity that is based on the dependency graph of your own code, and nothing of its own syntax!

It takes any piece of code and compiles it into an ordinary JavaScript function that can also run expressions in dependency threads!

Being function-based let's us have all of Subscript as a building blockâ€¦ to fit anywhere!
