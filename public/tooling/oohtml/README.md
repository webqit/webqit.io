## Robust, Web-Native UI Development

Think an all-new ability to author your entire UI from modular, reusable and granularly reactive HTML, letting you maintain a one-way or two-way binding with your JavaScript appliaction - and this time, **altogether based on just native web platform primitives and none of a framework**! OOHTML comes with all modern UI development paradigms built into the plain old HTML so you can go without a tool.

> **OOHTML is [being proposed as a native browser technology](https://discourse.wicg.io/t/proposal-chtml/4716) at the Web Platform Incubator Community Group. Consider joining the discussion.**
