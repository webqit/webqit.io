Worry not about anything beyond your code!
It's like localhost, but remote, global! We believe its time to bring it all home,
Cloud-native - the great equalizer; an equal playing field. Localhost + git.
Solutions; not low-level details
Think big - from localhost.
Your repo is the filesystem for the localhost.
A localhost experience - just how u work on localhost
We are always loosing something with every new era!
A good DX is when you're wearing VR glasses coding.
Split deploys.
Meets you where you’re at
Bring your friends.
Go all serverless - visit backendless.com to really try to understand what they do.
Great things are done when you're having a nice time!
Coding is the fun part
Deploying an app requires ... but in a serverless world, do we still need them?
Codify your opps
So that your not a parttime ops engineer?
We're codyfying DevOps! 
With WebQit Cloud, operations shift from ticket-driving ops to API driven Ops
Is the cloud turning you into a devOps?
A cloud that doesn't too much. 

As development has evolved, so should deployment!

Since web standards aren't just a thing of the frontend, you're going to have to
need a web-native backend for your applications!

Since modern wisdom is all about leveraging native capabilities!

A cloud-native infrastructure that is web-native ready! Just go live!

- Faster flights!

Since the cloud isnt't exactly the same as your localhost, there is the
possibility of losing the goodness of the web-native approach.

Imagine a cloud that is preloaded with the technologies you'll need 
for your web-native apps!

Web-Native development is a development approach that leverages
the capabilities of the web platform and the syntax of web standards

With all emphasis today now about speed, security, etc, 

----------
A web-native infrastructure is one that keys into the core principles of
the web-native approach.
Design-level guarantees
Infrastructure-level support for certain --- to furthee keep your application code lean.
DX: instant
DX: ordinary, zero cognitive load, no knowledge gap
COST: Happy to sleep. Gives you the cost benefits of sleeping.
Itself buil as a web-native app. Itself at your service.
Streamlined Experience that yields better web-native craftsmanship
Overnight ideas lauched by morning!
The speed for Web-Native
The simplicity for Web-Native
Just-in-time/ahead-of-time updates
----------

Takes the output of web-native as input for modern web architecture!

Core web architectures
"As an app developer, I don’t care that it runs on Solaris, FreeBSD, or Mac-OS. I want it to work. I want an optimized deployment workflow and a simple way to monitor and keep things running."

Imagine a cloud that is purpose-built to unleash the full potential of web-native apps in production!
Imagine a cloud that is purpose-built to give web-native apps an edge in production!

On getting your technology, tooling, and syntax choices right, it will be time to make infrastructre choices.
You'll need a cloud that is purpose-built to bring the benefits of web-native apps to production!
- Static and CDNs - Web-Native Infrastructure lets web-native apps Leverage the idea of CDNs
    Your public folder is cloned away into a Content Delivery Network! That lets your
    app key into modern ...
    When you deploy an app to webflo-runtime, the idea of this and that (also known as the Jamstack methodology) kicks in!
- all in one platform - compute and storage, but not in different platforms - benefits that add up now, plus stay in line for the good thinking - surface area for the impact - e.g a wholistic infrastructure where everything + wholeistic and on-time updates - automatically - without you having the responsibility to keep up

The web-native approach can be your extra edge in production and this will depend on your infrastructure - that can extend the benefits of the web-native approach in production to give you and your users the complete story!

- A revenue model that relies, not on propreitory-nesss, but on openness; not on exclusivity but on openness; not on being propreitory, but being open source. Otherwise, you be getting only a part of the story, if not a false sense of it altogether.

---------------------
The web today is not all about 
This would help achieve at least three things - with something for both developers and end users:
- less dependency on JavaScript - (the push for making Client-side scripting optional without a broken web) smaller application bundles, faster Time to Interaction (with less dependencies), fewer resource loading (with less dependencies), support for clients with limited, or disabled, scripting capabilities - overall improved UX.
- standardisation with the community - less controversies which is especially uncalled for on simple matters like this
- improved authoring experience - by virtue of being declarative - simplicity (readability, neatness, zero boilerplate), better maintainability.
What OOHTML has tried to acheive is the third point. Dependency- and toolchain-free development is possible again.
---------------------
Whatever the rendering model that works better for your business (SEO vs less compute) and users ().
---------------------
Features of Web-Native Development (something more original/most original to the web). Having built an application with an approach that embodies the original ideas and technologies of the web.
- less controversies
- less career tradeoffs and vendor-oriented career paths
---------------------
A paradigm shift from the framework monoculture and vendor play to the native-first culture.
---------------------
Web-Native is the winning culture for the web.
---------------------
Progressive enhancement to vanilla HTML, CSS, JS.
*Progressively-adoptable features* of standard languages and primitives - vs - being a framework that determines the 
min footprint/ full blue print
features that can come in progressively, as an afterthought vs

multiple extensionpoints,
multiple touchpoints,
multiple attack vectors
