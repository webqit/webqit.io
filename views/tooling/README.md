## WebQit Tooling

This is an ecosystem of open source tooling that provides a holistic approach to engineering modern web applications. Take home all the goodness of the web-native approach - where every challenge is met first with just the conventional web languages and APIs that have historically been obscured or even sometimes completely traded.

Contributions are welcome on each project! Help report typos and bugs via github issues, or submit a fix. Contributions are taken promptly and are well-acknowledged!

## Web-Native

Play UI maintains a native-centric approach of letting vanilla JavaScript (and ES6+) meet every challenge as a first step before thinking out of the box. This lets you and your app get all the goodness of modern JavaScript!

+ Conventional syntax.
+ A minimal footprint and streamlined feature set.
+ A web-native performance.

We thought to revisit much of the assumptions that brought us here.

Today's demands are simply not met by yesterdayâ€™s software architectures.

The web for the rest of us.

By web-native, we mean something more empowering than being just a cousin to a framework! Web-native tooling lets you work ALSO in vanilla JavaScript, not TIE you up to a framework.

Developers are tying their whole world - applications/careers - to a framework, with both immediate and long-term consequences. Web-native is a term for tooling with design and architecture that maintains cousinship to none of a framework but native web platform APIs and paradigms; that hold true universally.
