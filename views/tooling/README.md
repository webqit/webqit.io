### Magical, Yet Traditional - the WebQit Advantage!
Since the modern web, every new magic has had something to change in our conventional way of thinking and doing things. For every feature X, "modern tooling" has had to alter something in how we authour and ship HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and overall, in how we build and maintian modern applications. For some reasons, we haven't had the benefit of *both* "modern" and "traditional". How we miss the latter!

Come to a new way to think about tooling where everything suprisingly becomes possible with *little or zero engineering*; where the magic happens in the conventions of the traditional web. This is the possibility we explore with WebQit tooling. It comes on a clean slate bringing the benefits of *both* the *modern magic* and a *traditional developer experience*. This is the WebQit advantage!

### The Web-Native Future - Our Subject of Advocacy!
In the era of startling advancements with ES6+ and CSS, there's now a native approach to 4 out of every 5 problems. And sooner than anyone thinks, the fifth will be here! Thus comes the web of the future leaning back on its standard conventions and tooling for building web apps! We call this the *web-native future*! If there's anything we want to be known for, it will be having a part to play in this!

Through proposals and associated polyfills, we are indeed participating in web standardization. And with the launch of the [Web-Native (W3C) Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/web-native/), we're set to join in driving community uptake of Web-Native tooling. [Join](https://www.w3.org/community/web-native/join) us in *facilitating* and *embracing* the Web-Native future where everyone is banking more on the platform and less on abstractions.
